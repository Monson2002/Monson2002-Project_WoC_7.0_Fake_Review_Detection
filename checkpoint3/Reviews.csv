"Value for money is something that we don't associate with brands like Daikin but definetly it is worth every rupee. The AC was delivered by amazon at the pre appointed time. The delivery agent was very courteous and helful. The installation also happened on the very same day as Daikin is very prompt. The AC was however installed by a 3rd party vendor rather than Daikin's own staff. The box contained 3 meters of both HP & LP copper pipe and the outdoor to indoor unit wire. Additional purchase was the drain pipe, wire from main switch to the outdoor unit (Daikin AC is connected to power supply via the outdoor unit i.e. the power is first connected to the outdoor unit for which you will need a 1.5 sq mm good brand 3 core cable and then the indoor unit is connect to the outdoor unit by a 4 core cable which is provided with the AC) and extra consumables which in my case was additional 1 ft of copper pipe @ Rs. 304/ft and a meter of the 4 core cable used to connect the indoor unit to outdoor unit as the one supplied in the box was 3 meter.
Installation was not that great as the installation guys did not care if that was a new AC and left hand prints from dust all iver the AC which I am yet to figure out how to remove.
The first impression of the AC is great. It quickly cools my 200 sq ft room in under 5 mins. The AC is very silent and you'll barely feel and noise. Once the room reaches the desired teampreature the compressor speed reduces and maintains this constant teampreature. Remote is OK and does the necessary function."
"We purchased this AC on April 20. The installation was done by an authorized Daikin technician one Mr Tahiruddin. Within a month, it was not cooling at all. On June 9, I raised a ticket and the same technician came and inspected it the next day. He said the gas has leaked and needed to be refilled. For that a scaffolding needed to be put up. I said I would get it done the day next, which I did but no one from their end came over untill June 16, even after repeated phone calls. On June 16, the gas was refilled and the leak was allegedly taken care of but cooling still took a long time. All other ACs we have are of Daikin and so far we were quite satisfied with its performance. This experience, however, has left us utterly disappointed. I will not purchase Daikin product anymore, and will definitely not recommend it to anyone as well."
Satisfied with the AC
Genuine product. Excellent cooling. Remote could have been better.
Installation is good … person are to supportive…
Useless installation. Horrible ODU support bracket after spending 35000/- on AC. Installation is just one month old. I think AC will last longer than Bracket which is rusted badly and paint has already peeled off. Pathetic!!!
"The product delivered was good. For installation they gave a quotation of 3.5k however when technician visited he gave the quotation for 6.5k it’s literally double the price that was previously communicated. They arrived without vacuum which is mandatory for the installation of new device and even technician tried to convince that vacuum is not required for installation!! My regular technician had to visit to make them understand this basic thing. Had to wait for 2-3 hours for them to get the vacuum and complete the installation process.
Overall the installation process took 5-6 hours to complete so in a way not so happy with the installation service but not disappointed either as the behaviour of the technician and service centre was good and they coordinated properly and my work was done."
Installation completed today and works fine. Value for money.
