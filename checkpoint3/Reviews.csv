"These were a replacement for my grandson. He came to me and said he wanted to get these ones. The reviews looked great!! The ear pieces are soft and comfortable he says. the mic works perfectly. The sound is nice crisp and clear. And the cord on it is just about perfect as well. Maybe a little longer but works perfectly. Also, they are holding up to his little brothers shinanigans as well. Quite durable indeed. Thank you for offering a great headset for the Xbox. and a great price!!"
"Got this headset for my new PC and it works great. No issues setting up and itâ€™s a great value. The sound is great and Iâ€™ve had no complaints on the microphone. The cord length is great, they definitely give you enough room. I love the color options, the white matches my set up perfectly. So far they have lasted and held up great. I definitely recommend is youâ€™re looking for a really good inexpensive headset for pc!"
"purchased this gaming headset for my teenage son, and it has exceeded all expectations! The build quality is fantasticâ€”it's incredibly sturdy and holds up well to daily use (and the occasional accidental drop). My son absolutely loves it and says it's the best headset he's ever used.

The sound quality is crystal clear, with great balance between game audio and chat, which makes it perfect for his online gaming sessions with friends. It works seamlessly with his Xbox, and the plug-and-play setup was a breeze.

The comfort level is also worth mentioningâ€”the cushioned ear pads and adjustable headband mean he can wear it for hours without any discomfort. This headset has definitely enhanced his gaming experience, and as a parent, Iâ€™m thrilled with the quality and durability. Highly recommend it for any gamer!"
"Iâ€™ve been using this headset for a few weeks now, and itâ€™s absolutely fantastic. The sound quality is crystal clear, with rich bass and sharp treble that make every gaming session immersive. The noise-canceling microphone is a game-changerâ€”it picks up my voice perfectly while filtering out background noise, so my teammates can hear me loud and clear.

Comfort-wise, this headset is top-notch. The ear cushions are plush and breathable, and I can wear it for hours without any discomfort. It also feels sturdy but lightweight, so it doesnâ€™t weigh me down.

The build quality is impressive, with a sleek design and durable materials that feel premium. The RGB lighting adds a fun touch without being too over-the-top.

Setup was super easyâ€”just plug and play! Itâ€™s compatible with my PC, console, and even my phone. Overall, this headset is a must-have for any gamer looking to upgrade their gear. Highly recommend!"
Easy to use and they look great. My daughter also said they have great sound. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was having to plug the headphones into the Playstation with a different cable to get the headphones to light up. Lots of wires hanging around.
"after having these headphones for several months i feel comfortable enough to leave a review. these are fairly great quality for the price. the sound quality is so good at about half way that i find it difficult to hear the chaos with two toddlers. ðŸ˜‚ (someone else is obviously watching them at this time) the mic is good and ive had no complaints when others hear me. overall the headphones feel good on my head/ears and everything seems to work amazingly well. ðŸ˜Š very happy with this purchase, i feel like most times when buying cheaper end items they fail to work after about 6 months. but not these! plus they are extremely stylish!"
Excellent Gaming Headphones. Works great with our XBox1. Super cool design! Comfortable for hours of gaming. Clear sound and microphone works great. Would definitely buy again!
"I don't play many multiplayer games anymore that require voice chat, but my son wanted me to join his voyages on Sea of Theives for the Xbox, so I bought this to try out.

It was perfect! I was able to hear everything going on around me as our ship was set a blaze by much better players. I have used a few of these in the past and this one stands above the rest in price and quality. Fits the budget perfectly.

The fact that the microphone can articulate closer to your mouth, instead of just a up and down movement is a major plus.

I will definitely be buying another for backup purposes!"
